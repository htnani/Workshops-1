# Where's my data!
You should find your data on XXXXXXX

The first thing to do is load it.

- Login to galaxy
- On the left pane you have a 'Get Data' header, click it
- Choose 'Upload File'

We need to setup information for Galaxy to process the file correctly.
We will be uploaded a 1000genome sub-sampled dataset in BAM format.

Choose BAM format and upload your BAM 'NA12878.sorted.bam'

pick the right Genome, ours is Human b37.
What's the difference?


The problem is, many sites, like ours, gives the data in BAM (Binary Alignment Map) format.
Since we want to try out the steps manually, we need to transform the data
