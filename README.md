# Introduction to DNA-Seq processing
This workshop will show you how to work with sequenced cancer datasets

We will be working on a CageKid sample pair, patient C0098.
The CageKid project is part of ICGC and is focused on renal cancer in many of it's forms.
The raw data can be found on EGA and calls, RNA and DNA, can be found on the ICGC portal.
More details about CageKid here:

For practical reasons we subsampled the reads from the sample because running the whole dataset would take way too much time and resources.
