# Bioinformatics of Next-Gen Sequencing
In the coming day we will show you different bioinformatics approaches to analyse NGS experiments.

Your datasets are from DNA-Seq, RNA-Seq and Small RNA-Seq.

We will analyse the DNA-Seq using Galaxy[https://usegalaxy.org/]
The RNA-Seq will be done exclusively from the command line
The Small RNA-Seq will mostly be done with Galaxy.

For practical reasons the hands on will not be done on your data, we leave this part to you as an excersise. We will use smaller datasets except for Small RNA
